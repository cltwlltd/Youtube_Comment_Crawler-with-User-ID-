## How to:
1. Install a ChromeDriver from right here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2. Remember *where* you saved the ChromeDriver.
3. You should also have Google Chrome installed.
4. You will see the line that starts with "with Chrome(executable_path" in the thrid cell from the attached Python code file. Copy and paste the path where your ChromeDriver was saved. (I saved mine in C:\Program Files. if you did the same, you won't have to change the code I wrote)
5. Run the code!

## A Word of Caution:
Depending on your network environment, it may take longer to load the comments from each scroll-down. <br/>
Note that there is going to be a difference between the total number of comments you see on the Youtube page and the number of rows of the csv file. (since the crawler will not scrape the replies of the comments)
